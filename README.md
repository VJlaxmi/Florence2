# Florence-2: Advancing a Unified Representation for a Variety of Vision Tasks


Florence-2 is an advanced vision foundation model that uses a prompt-based approach to handle a wide range of vision and vision-language tasks. 

Florence-2 can interpret simple text prompts to perform tasks like captioning, object detection, and segmentation. 

It leverages our FLD-5B dataset, containing 5.4 billion annotations across 126 million images, to master multi-task learning. 

The model's sequence-to-sequence architecture enables it to excel in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, proving to be a competitive vision foundation model.
